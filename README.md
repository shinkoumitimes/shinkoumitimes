## $${\color{lightblue}All\ about\ me!}$$
Haaaaaaaaai I'm Ren, if ur reading this u prob came from ponytown, if not then where did u find me lol (idrgaf, read if u want), so heres everything about me!

I'm totally a major fujoshi, if u don't like that then just hide me, but just know I do not want u and ur ugly ass bf cuz ur gay, sorry

I am agender and aroace, I use they/them pronouns, and I am a bit autistic. I love visual novels, anything gross, and pokemon games! I do like more stuff than that, but I really cannot list that off the top of my head.. It's totally boring anyways! I'm not getting into that.

I do not have a dni, and I'd love it if anyone interacted with me! Though, I block very freely and if you annoy me or weird me out then ur getting blocked LOL
 
 Though i do not have a dni, here are some fandoms I wouldn't want to interact with due to personal prefrence.
 - Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss
 - Roblox Myths
 - Dandy's world (HEAVY on this)

#

As of now, I am mainly fixated on
 - Slow Damage
 - Dramatical Murder
 - Togainu No Chi
 - Honkai Impact 3rd
 - D4DJ
 - Blue Archive (Yes, that blue archive.)

My faves;
 - Eiji (SD) ((obviously..))
 - Haxxor bunny / Bronie (Hi3rd)
 - Noiz (DMMD)
 - Sparkle (Hsr)
 - Blade (Hsr)
 - Honorable mention, Virus (DMMD)

If you scrolled this far down, then hi lol why did you read through this. I am also making a strawpage since my old one is kinda ugly now, so i'll have this up along with that sooner or later. Thanks for reading!

***Lovingly signed, Ren.***

 (P.S, i am way too serious with this half the time i never even use grammar... literally every other word is a spelling mistake, idk why im so into this. WHOOPS!)

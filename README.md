## $${\color{lightblue}All\ about\ me!}$$
Haaaaaaaaai I'm Ren, if ur reading this u prob came from ponytown, if not then where did u find me lol this was meant for ponytown (idrgaf, read if u want), so heres everything about me!

I'm totally a major fujoshi, if u don't like that then just hide me, but just know I do not want u and ur ugly ass bf cuz ur gay, sorry

I am agender and aroace, I use they/them pronouns, and I am a bit autisticâ€”someone told me to kill myself because of this part, so since I'm not allowed to be sarcastic, **I am clinically diagnosed with autism. Don't know why I'm not allowed to make jokes anymore, but maybe I should add tone tags to this because some people clearly can't get the message that I AM autistic**. I love visual novels, anything gross, and pokemon games! I do like more stuff than that, but I really cannot list that off the top of my head.. It's totally boring anyways! I'm not getting into that.

I do not have a dni, and I'd love it if anyone interacted with me! Though, I block very freely and if you annoy me or weird me out then ur getting hidden LOL
 
 Though i do not have a dni, here are some fandoms I wouldn't want to interact with due to personal prefrence.
 - Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss
 - Roblox Myths
 - Dandy's world (HEAVY on this)
 - Forsaken / Phighting / trud (?)
 - Crk (crob is the only cookie run based fandom I'd prefer interacting with)

This doesnt apply to when I am in roleplays because I literally have to interact w/ u, I promise if u are in a rp with me, see this, and are on this list you can interact because I wouldn't want the rp dying because I refuse to talk to someone...
I have nothing against you *if* you like these things, but I generally have bad experiences with these fandoms and would prefer not interacting with them. That and or I just find the fandom annoying and don't want to end up telling u to shut up because thats rude, but I am genuinely horrible at keeping to myself so PLEASE do not interact with me outside of roleplays if you like these things.

If you scrolled this far down, then hi lol why did you read through this.

Aand, if you're wondering why my skins might look a little scuffed when it comes to brightness, it's because I usually have my phone brightness set to half and I end up thinking my colors are pretty dark. Most of the time, they are not. I may fix it one day, but honestly I'm too lazy for that, so.. Just bear with way too bright skin on my skins for now.

My strawpage is linked, if you wanna say anything. Drawings on strawpage are down, buuuttt if they get fixed then I'll link something dedicated to any art I'm sent! Like a google slides or something, with my own input with every slide. I'll also leave answers to any questions I get there too lol.
***Lovingly signed, Ren.***

 (P.S, i am way too serious with this half the time i never even use grammar... literally every other word is a spelling mistake, idk why im so into this. WHOOPS!)
